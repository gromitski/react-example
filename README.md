This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you got Node installed and NPM installed.
Verify by running `node --version` & `npm --version`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Etc.

Dont worry about the `/public` directory for now.

Get started by looking at `src/index.js`.
Afterwards I highly recommend looking at `src/pages/Home/index.js`.
